This project is focused on the design and implementation of a robust relational database system tailored for an airport ticketing environment. The objective was to translate real-world business requirements into a scalable and normalized relational model that could efficiently manage various operations involved in the airport’s ticketing workflow. These included handling passenger registrations, flight schedules, employee ticketing roles, booking reservations, issuing tickets, and tracking baggage.
The system was expected to not only support daily operational transactions but also deliver meaningful insights through analytical queries. To ensure the database was structurally sound, the design followed best practices in normalization, progressing through UNF to 3NF to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity. A relational schema was then developed and implemented using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), incorporating essential elements such as table creation with primary and foreign keys, data validation through constraints, and the establishment of relationships between core entities.
Beyond the schema design, business logic was embedded through stored procedures, views, and triggers to automate tasks like inserting employees, retrieving passengers by last name, and auto-assigning ticket seats. Each component was tested with realistic data inputs, ensuring the database could respond to real-world queries such as passenger demographics, staff workload analysis, and baggage tracking.
This task provided an opportunity to demonstrate not only technical competency in SQL but also the ability to model a complex domain scenario with accuracy, efficiency, and future scalability in mind. The final product reflects a complete cycle of database development—from analysis and design to implementation, testing, and reporting.
